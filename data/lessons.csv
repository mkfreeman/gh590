Students will use online platforms to experiment with simple HTML elements and adjusting their styles via CSS.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture1t,technicalThe role of interactive data visualization in global health,"To begin the course, we will explore the ways in which interactive data visualization has transformed the global health space. Descriptive epidemiology, impact evaluation, and disease prioritization have all been impacted by the use of (interactive) visualizations.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture1c,conceptualUser driven design for global health,"The user driven design process that we will focus on challenges visualization developers to understand the goals, questions, and skill levels of potential users. Understanding the users in the global health field is fundamental to developing visualizations that can be effective and impactful.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture2c,conceptualIntroduction to Javascript,"Javascript, the most popular programming language in the world, is a dynamic scripting language that be used to manipulate HTML elements. We will cover javascript object properties, and practice using common functionality.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture2t,technicalGraphical perception (1/2),"Understanding how humans visually perceive graphical properties is the foundation of building visualizations. This first section covers a typology of datatypes (nominal, ordinal, categorical) and pre-attentive cognition.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture3c,conceptualD3: Data Driven Documents (1/2),"This lectured introduces the Javascript library D3. D3, the most commonly used web- visualization package, enables users to dynamically create, transition, and manipulate HTML elements.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture3t,technicalGraphical perception (2/2),"Continuing the theme of graphical perception, this lecture discusses a hierarchy of effectiveness for graphical encodings based on different datatypes. We will cover examples within health that have successfully (and not successfully) used these principles.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture4c,conceptualD3: Data Driven Documents (2/2),"An extension of the previous D3 lecture: adding, removing, and manipulating different types of elements on a webpage.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture4t,technicalInteractivity,"This lecture examines effective ways to leverage interactivity in data visualizations. We will consider visual queues that imply interactive methods, and consider how effective these queues are for different users in global health.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture5c,conceptualEveryone loves maps,"Global health information is frequently displayed on maps, but in which situations are maps effective visualizations? This lecture explores examples of maps as data visualizations, and challenges when they are effective.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture6c,conceptualEveryone loves maps,"The D3 package has built in functionality for building maps and coloring each location based on a dataset. Today, we'll build a map using D3.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture6t,technical"Buttons, dropdowns, and sliders","To build selection functionality for visualizations, we'll use the Javascript library jQuery to create multiple types of controls which can be used to update the data being shown in a visualization.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture7t,technicalVisualization ethics and evaluation,"Given our goal of impacting global health, what are the ethical implications involved with visualizations? We will also consider how to conceptualize and measure the effectiveness of a visualization.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture8c,conceptualD3 layouts,"In this exercise, we'll explore D3's built in algorithms for organizing data into different spatial layouts, including proportional and hierarchical data (stacked bar charts, treemaps, etc.)",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture8t,technicalNarrative visualizations in global health,"In large health datasets, there are myriad stories to be told, so how can you build specific, compelling stories into an interactive data visualization? We will examine examples, and provide a framework for integrating directed stories into visual tools.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture9c,conceptualBuilding Applications,"Designing more advanced applications such as multiple integrated charts, or multiple views of the data requires more generalizable methods of programming: this lecture introduces these approaches.",http://mkfreeman.github.io/gh590/lecture9t,technical
